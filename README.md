The project aims to generate a generic online reimbursement portal which aims to provide users an environment where every type of reimbursement can take place. In the present scenario, there is no generic system of reimbursement leading to various problems for employees like transparency between the various transactions. The UI provides with a login system where the government employee enters the government employee ID for various reimbursement purposes including Electricity, Education, Travel and Hospital. The database takes care that no other employee except certain Government employees claims the reimbursement and hence has provided a separate registration form for the government employees and a login form for the employees to login. The employee will enter the bill and transaction details to claim certain amount of reimbursement and the transaction status will be checked which may be approved or rejected as per the requirements.
